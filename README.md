# Anti-Fraud-System
## What is it?
Project from hyperskill "Java backend developer" course.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/232?track=12
This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector. 
In this project, I created a system with an expanded role model, a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, 
and an internal transaction validation logic based on a set of heuristic rules.
